/*LAYERED_SND_SHOOT by Alundaio
When defined, it will allow you to play a group of sounds from a specified section for snd_shoot.
You can have as many layers as you want, but you must follow naming convention,

snd_1_layer
snd_2_layer
snd_3_layer
...

You can also have different variants for each layer defined,

snd_1_layer
snd_1_layer1
snd_1_layer2
...

The correct line settings are standard, (ie. snd_1_layer = sound_path, volume, delay)
ex.

Here is an example usage:
snd_shoot = new_snd_section

[new_snd_section]
snd_1_layer = weapons\new_sound_shoot1
snd_1_layer1 = weapons\new_sound_shoot2
snd_1_layer2 = weapons\new_sound_shoot3
snd_1_layer3 = weapons\new_sound_shoot4

snd_2_layer = weapons\mechanical_noise, 1.0, 0.1

snd_3_layer = weapons\gunshot_echo, 1.0, 0.8
