TITLE: Commit message conventions

The format of commit message should be a short description of what you did.
After the description, the bug ID, review ID or anything else.

The commit log should not contain the obvious. If you change file Foo.cpp:

 BAD:
    "Fix bug in Foo.cpp"
 BAD:
    "Fix #45"
 BAD:
    "Commit Foo.cpp"
 GOOD:
    "Fix buffer overflow (close #45)."

The above does not mean that when you do a complex change do not write a
description of what you did, on the contrary. When a long description is
needed do add as much as needed to explain the change, just do not add
meaningless information (committing Foo.cpp etc.)

It is advisable to split complex commits to several smaller commits if
possible. If you see that your commit massage contain more then one topic, you
probably can and should split the commit into a few unrelated commits.
