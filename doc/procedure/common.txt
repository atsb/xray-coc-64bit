TITLE: Common conventions

File and directory names:
- Unless otherwise specified, use lower_case.
- Source code files and VS projects: use PascalCase.
- When you need to define the same entity with several files, you can use lowercase suffixes:
 BAD (both files implement the same Matrix44 class, but differ in implementation details)
    Matrix44xm.hpp
    Matrix44noxm.hpp
 GOOD
    Matrix44_xm.hpp
    Matrix44_noxm.hpp

- Keep it simple.
- VS projects that represent engine modules should have 'xr' prefix in their names.
- VS projects and their root directories should have the same names.

Formatting (for text files in /doc/ directory):
- Shift width (indentation) is 2 spaces.
- Never use tabs.
- Line size is 120 columns.
- File should begin with 'TITLE: ' followed by document title.
