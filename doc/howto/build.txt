Build Luajit-2:

You cannot compile luajit 2+ from Visual Studio. To build it you will need to open VS developer command console, cd to your "3rd party/luajit-2/src" folder
and execute msvcbuild.bat. This will build lua51.lib and lua51.dll. Copy the dll to %XRAY_16X_GAME%bin_rel folder.

It's very important to note you NEED the changes made to the vanilla gulag_general.script which can be found in xray-16\res\gamedata\gulag_general.script
To be more specific, a forward slash needs removed from  [local ini_path = "\scripts\\"..work] to look like [local ini_path = "scripts\\"..work]
